  "uvpTitle": "Why Us?",
  "uvpDescription1": "Tech consultancy can be inordinately expensive. In a world with ever increasing technical demands, and too few people capable of delivering it, hiring one or two staff can be the difference between a comfortable profit, and loss. History is plagued with stories of horrendous cost over-runs of technical projects, yet billion dollar tech start-ups can launch with a few thousand pounds. Why?",
  "uvpDescription2": "It's all down to the methodology. A start up will get the minimum needed to function done as quickly as possible, and iterate quickly. This removes costly scope changes near project completion, and allows problems to be identified as soon as they appear. We're in the buisiness of applying these modern work flows and management styles to everything we build. Aiming to demonstrate wire-frames within days, and release candidates in weeks. Only using the most modern of automated workflow control, changes can be seen live within minutes or second. Truly lean fast paced development saving money and stopping errors.",
